# Life Expectancy Analysis
In this project I analyze a dataset on life expectancy for males and females of different income groups.

# Summary Analysis
While exploring this dataset, several notable patterns and trends emerged
<br>
1. Income Group and Life Expectancy
    - There exists a correlation between income groups and life expectency
    - Individuals in higher income groups exhibit a higher life expectancy compared to those in lower income groups
    - The highest life expectancy is observed in the high-income group, while the lowest is found in the low-income group

2. Gender Disparities
  - Females consistenly outlive males by an average of 4-5 years each year from 2000 to 2019
  - This gender gap is greatest in the high-income group and smallest in the low-income groups

3. Trends
  - Over time the gender gap in life expectancy has shown a decreasing trend, especially after 2010. This would suggest that the gap is narrowing even though females continue to have a longer life expectancy

# Inferences
Based on the observed trends, there are several inferences that can be made.
<br>
1. Continued Gender Gap Reduction
  - It seems that the gender gap in life expectency will continue to decrease as time goes on
2. Gender Disparity
  - Despite improvements, females are expected to maintain a higher life expectancy than males in all income groups
3. Low-Income Groups
  - In the near future, it's likely that low-income females will surpass the life expectency of males in tge low-nmiddle income group
